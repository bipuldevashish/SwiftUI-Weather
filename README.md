# 🌦️ SwiftUI Weather App

A sleek and simple weather app built using **SwiftUI** as part of my learning journey. This project is currently **under development** and serves as a playground to explore and practice SwiftUI fundamentals, including declarative UI, data binding, MVVM architecture, animations, and API integration.

## ✨ Features (In Progress)

- 🌍 Fetches real-time weather data using OpenWeatherMap API  
- 📍 Location-based weather updates  
- 💡 Clean and responsive SwiftUI interface  
- 🌡️ Displays temperature, weather conditions, and more  
- 🔄 Pull-to-refresh functionality  
- 🎨 Light and dark mode support  

## 🎯 What I Aim to Learn

- SwiftUI layout and view composition  
- Working with Combine and property wrappers like `@State`, `@Binding`, and `@ObservedObject`  
- Networking in Swift using `URLSession`  
- Implementing MVVM architecture in SwiftUI  
- JSON decoding and model handling  
- Building reusable and dynamic components in SwiftUI
